# JSONGenerator
This program takes in a .tsv (tab-delimited) file and generates a .json (JavaScript Object Notation) file out of it.

# History
I developed this program as a tool to be used for my game development team, as we are developing a CCG. The card designers put the information into an Excel spreadsheet, so rather than manually put that information from the spreadsheet into a JSON file, I automated the process. I used the tab-delimited format because it is the easiest to split up based on how the spreadsheet is constructed.
