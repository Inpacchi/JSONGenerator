# JSONGenerator
This program takes in a .tsv (tab-delimited) file and generates a .json (JavaScript Object Notation) file out of it.

# History
I developed this program as a tool to be used for my game development team, as we are developing a CCG. The card designers put the information into an Excel spreadsheet, so rather than manually put that information from the spreadsheet into a JSON file, I automated the process. I used the tab-delimited format because it is the easiest to split up based on how the spreadsheet is constructed.

# Usage
Installation is not required. I used [ILMerge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17630) to package the project together into one single .exe file that can be executed portably. 

As of right now, it is only meant for personal use with a game I am developing. I will be making a generic version of the file that can be modified for any .tsv or .csv file down the line.
